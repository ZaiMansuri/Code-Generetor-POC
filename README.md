#Code generater of IoT Intigration in node + react.

### Simple File Upload with Node Js and React that convert your intigration into code 
I have used the Create React App and the Antd package to quick setup the UI.
Just run the ```npm start``` to run the React Js app.

The Node Js server code is added to the seperate directory. First you have navigate the **server** directory and then run ```npm start``` to start the Node Js server.
